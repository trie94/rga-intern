## Overview
This is an intern project at R/GA Portland, Summer 2018. Tilt is a chrome extension & website that helps people understand their bias by analyzing their media intake. I built a proof of concept for a weekly report that summarizes users' media intake with pseudo data that is randomly generated based on parameters.
